# Bowling Scorecard

##Bowling Scorecard

This project allows a single user to count and sum the scores of a bowling game.

This is the Week 5 challenge, which followed on from a week learning the fundamentals of a new programming language (Javascript) and building a web app using JS, Jquery, HTML and CSS, whilst using Jasmine to TDD build.

To complete this challenge I used the MVC model in order to keep code clean and readable.
